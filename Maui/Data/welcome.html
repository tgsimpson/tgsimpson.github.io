	<h1> Slow Maui </h1>
  <h2> Exploring Maui over Years, not Days </h2>

	<p> Maui has a lot to discover; this is a personal recording of both things done and things yet-to-do. We (my wife and I) have been coming to Maui for many years. Now we live here, and are taking our time to truly explore the island.</p>
  <p> If you want a travel book, get Maui Revealed. This site is more for random browsing by location. Are you going to be in Makena? Perhaps there's something nearby that we've done that will pique your interest.</p>
  <p> You'll see that we like to build things - sandcastles, rock or coral stacks. Lots of pictures with those - sorry :) </p>
  <p> When you click on a location you get a picture (or a few) representing that spot.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> &#128994;  We've checked it out: pictures and a "story", accessible by way of the &#128214; in the upper left. If the border of the dot is blue, we have more to do at this spot.</li>
    <li> &#128309; We've checked it out: There are some pictures, maybe a short description, but nothing more in-depth. </li>
    <li> &#128993; High on our priority / planning list, but not trivial. &#128214; is planning notes moreso than a description </li>
    <li> &#128308; It's on our list (we've probably driven by, but haven't really explored the place)</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Exit this screen, to the map, using the X in the upper right.</p>
  <p> Happy exploring.</p>
  <p> Todd and Anar.</p>
  <p> Got ideas for improvements, or things we've missed. Drop us a note at todd.g.m.simpson@gmail.com </p>
