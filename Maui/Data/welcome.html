	<h1> Slow Maui </h1>
  <h2> Exploring Maui over Years, not Days </h2>

  <p> ** This site is best on desktop / tablet; not yet optimized for mobile. **
  <p> We used to travel and tick locations and experiences off of lists. Then, somehow, we changed to 'slow' mode - spend an entire vacation at a single location, trying to get a real feel for the place. We've visited Maui many times and done many of the top rated tourist recommendations. Now we live here, and have the opportunity to go slow and go deep. </p>
	<p> This is a record of our wandering and a list of things we want to do.</p>
  <p> If you want a travel book, get Maui Revealed. This site is more for serendipity, based on location. Or, maybe for people who like to browse maps, not indexes.</p>
  <p> You'll see that we like to build things - sandcastles, rock or coral stacks. Lots of pictures with those - sorry :) </p>
  <p> When you click on a location you get a picture (or a few) representing that spot. Sometimes there's a short note. Sometimes there's a longer story.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> &#10540;  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the upper right hand corner will close the current screen and return to the previous one.
    <li> &#128214; &nbsp&nbsp If there is a story/note/description, this icon will show up in the upper left of the pictures screen.
    <li> &#128994; &nbsp&nbsp There's more than pictures here. Click &#128214; in the upper left of the picture pages. </li>
    <li> &#128309; &nbsp&nbsp We've checked it out: There are some pictures, maybe a short description, but nothing more in-depth. </li>
    <li> &#128993; &nbsp&nbsp High on our priority / planning list, but not trivial. &#128214; is more planning notes than description </li>
    <li> &#128308; &nbsp&nbsp It's on our list to visit/do.</li>
    <li> &#128269; &nbsp&nbsp Will (one day) allow you to refine what's shown on the map; not implemented yet </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Next step: exit this screen, to the map, using the &#10540; in the upper right.</p>
  <p> Happy exploring.</p>
  <p> Have ideas for improvements, or things we've missed. Drop us a note at slow.maui.hawaii@gmail.com </p>
