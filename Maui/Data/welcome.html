	<h1> Slooow Maui </h1>
  <h2> Don't change Maui; let Maui change you. </h2>

  <p> Note: this site is an app, not a bunch of webpages; use the &#10540; (upper right) to 'go back', or in this case, to close the welcome page and go to the map. </p>

	<p> We're taking time to explore Maui in depth. This is a record of our wanderings and a list of things we want to do.</p>
  <p> If you want a travel book, get Maui Revealed. For generic search, use Google or Google maps </p>
  <p> This site is more about record-keeping, and perhaps serendipity. </p>
  <p> There are many beautiful places on earth, and Maui is certainly on the list. It's a different type of beauty than rocky mountains, glacial lakes, or miles of low sandy archipelago. It's an interesting mix of serene and wild, with almost every ecosystem imaginable, from rain forest to desert. While the tourist draws cover many of the best spots, we know there are more out of the way locations that will be worth striving for.</p>
  <p> Here's our color coding / controls:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> &#128994; &nbsp&nbsp There's more than pictures here. A write-up may appear immediatly, or click &#128214; in the upper left of the picture pages. </li>
    <li> &#128309; &nbsp&nbsp We've checked it out: There are some pictures, maybe a short description, but nothing more in-depth. </li>
    <li> &#x26AA;  &nbsp&nbsp We've been there, but no pics worth sharig yet. Might have to go back.</li>
    <li> &#128993; &nbsp&nbsp High on our priority / planning list, but not trivial. &#128214; is more planning notes than description </li>
    <li> &#128995; &nbsp&nbsp Miscelaneous stuff.
    <li> &#128308; &nbsp&nbsp It's on our list to visit/do.</li>
    <li> &#128214; &nbsp&nbsp If there is a story/note/description, this icon will show up in the upper left of the pictures screen. Often the write-up comes up by default.
    <li> &#10540;  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the upper right hand corner will close the current screen and return to the previous one.
    <li> &#128269; &nbsp&nbsp Allows you to filter what's shown on the map; *Note: not all pu'u have accurate lat/lng yet* </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Next step: exit this screen, to the map, using the &#10540; in the upper right.</p>
  <p> Happy exploring.</p>
