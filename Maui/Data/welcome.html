	<h1> Slow Maui </h1>
  <h2> Don't change Maui; let Maui change you. </h2>

	<p> We're taking time to explore Maui in depth. This is a record of our wanderings and a list of things we want to do.</p>
  <p> If you want a travel book, get Maui Revealed. For generic search, use Google or Google maps </p>
  <p> This site is more about record-keeping, and perhaps serendipity. </p>
  <p> Places are color coded, and may contain pictures and/or a write-up.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> &#10540;  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the upper right hand corner will close the current screen and return to the previous one.
    <li> &#128214; &nbsp&nbsp If there is a story/note/description, this icon will show up in the upper left of the pictures screen.
    <li> &#128994; &nbsp&nbsp There's more than pictures here. Click &#128214; in the upper left of the picture pages. </li>
    <li> &#128309; &nbsp&nbsp We've checked it out: There are some pictures, maybe a short description, but nothing more in-depth. </li>
    <li> &#128993; &nbsp&nbsp High on our priority / planning list, but not trivial. &#128214; is more planning notes than description </li>
    <li> &#128995; &nbsp&nbsp Miscelaneous stuff.
    <li> &#128308; &nbsp&nbsp It's on our list to visit/do.</li>
    <li> &#128269; &nbsp&nbsp Will (one day) allow you to refine what's shown on the map; *Note: not all pu'u have accurate lat/lng* </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Next step: exit this screen, to the map, using the &#10540; in the upper right.</p>
  <p> Happy exploring.</p>
  <p> Have ideas for improvements, or things we've missed. Drop us a note at slow.maui.hawaii@gmail.com </p>
