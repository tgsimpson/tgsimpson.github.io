    Visitors in town; good snorkeling at Baby Beach yesterday, and fun on paddleboards at Sugar beach today. <br>
    Fixing bugs on site. Things seem to work on Chrome now...but slideshow fading doesn't work on Safari and site is slow on Firefox.  Do I care?

    Beautiful morning at Keawakapu today - saw bioluminescent something-or-other (dinoflagellates?)

    Spent the last week completely refactoring in order to give better slideshow animations.... not there yet, but getting closer.

    <a href="../trails/lipoaloop.html">Lipoa Loop</a> trail is official open, so of course I did a quick loop this morning. Have to go back when it's light and get pictures of some of the (fun) signs they've put up.<br>
    Got image transitions working on canvas; need to incorporate into the main site. Also, don't know how to integrate video into that scheme, as it seems CORS will still block things. Guess I'll leave video on an iframe, and only worry about image transitions for now.

    Tracked down that Oanapuka is...nothing :) Write up is <a href="../trails/oanapuka.html">here</a>.<br>
    Also got a long way down the road to implementing a cool image transition scheme in javascript/canvas, only to learn that (of course) they don't allow what I was trying to do for CORS. Need to abandon that and try again. Sigh.

    Total lunar eclipse early this morning; didn't get any good pictures, but what was amazing was that the moon was so dim (orange) that the surrounding stars were brilliant. Brilliant.<br>
    Spent afternoon and evening in Lahaina, where the brush fire was burning. Write up is <a href="../random/LahainaFire.html">here</a>.

    On the mainland for 17 days. San Jose, Brooklyn, San Diego. <br>
    Added slide show (circles through all img files) <br>
    Added gpx2json for Garmin files; trails now show gps if it is included in the data. <br>

    Kalepolepo to Sugar Beach - Yesterday was not glass...today was.  <br>
    Skipped a lot of choral; 20+ skips sometimes as no wave interference today <br>
    Thousands of small fish (Lens says Silver-stripe round herring) washed up on the beach; strange <br>
    Practiced narrow step walking, assuing that compensates for cross-slope effort on the beach?? <br>
    Young Hihimanu ray on Keawakapu; no tail to speak of. <br>

    Did the NorthEast Lahaina-Pali trail for the first time. 90 min roundtrip / 80 min moving time without pushing it.<br>
    Met George from Maui Hikes at the top...potential partner for Kaupo Gap? <br>
    Short write up on the <a href="../trails/lahainapali.html">trail</a>; should add more pictures at some point. <br>
    Thinking about hiking efficiency the whole way. Uphill is elevation/slope optimization; downhill is about minimizing acceleration? Worth a write up at some point.<br>
    Did a small bit of the old Lahaina road, which intersects Lahaina-Pali at the trailhead. It's interesting, but noisy (from the road) and probably not worth doing fully.

    Went for a walk; Lipoa to new Hilton. Very high tide; no beach most of the way. <br>
    Clouds gathered on Haleakala in under 15 min - from clear to fully cloaked.

    Up early and headed to La Perouse Bay. Walked up Puʻu o Kanaloa as well as Puʻu Kalua o lapa. <br>
    Beautiful morning, 76F. Surprise was the clear view of the Big Island from Kanaloa. <br>
    Start at La Perouse near the gate, head into the lava fields to avoid the 'private' Makena Trail Rides area. <br>
    Then, work your way back North until you hit a wide trail. This will take you to both Puʻu easily. <br>
    There are lots of dry creek crossings, so easy to confuse the trail with creekbeds.
