    Snorkeling off Lanai, sailing on catamaran, swimming in middle of ʻAuʻau Channel with Sail Maui. Sea was glass!!! Color was the definition of aquamarine. Whale song was strong.

    Whale watching out of Lahaina with Trilogy V. Awesome. Saw 10+ whales. Two seperate instances of whales swimming below the boat, visible in the water, then surfacing just past us. Only thing we missed was a full breach...but otherwise, amazing.

    Went to the Summit earlier; got in no problem. <br>
    Clouds cleared up nicely at sunset...sunset was great, but more exciting we had a great view of Oahu in the distance (yes) as well as great views of the Big Island. <br>
    Stars were excellent - 1/8th moon, so a bit too much light. Really need to do this at new moon.

    Attempted the summit (to see the sunset/stars) with K+N; turned back at the park gates as the park was full. Have to go earlier next time.

    Snorkeling in Maalaea. Huge school of Yellow Striped Goatfish.  I guess they are quite tasty, with a hint of shrimp...given that's what they eat :)

    Why don't I carry my GoPro all the time?  Today I saw, in crystal clear water off Maalaea, a huge blue-spotted CoronetFish (I'd guess 5' long, although I still have trouble judging size underwater), as well as an absolutely beautiful male boxfish.

    Large school of RingTail SurgeonFish off of Makapu. Water was pretty murky....probably good for sharks, so I only followed them for a few minutes. They looked like they were 2' long, but the web says they get to a maximum size of 18-19".

    Visitors in town; good snorkeling at Baby Beach yesterday, and fun on paddleboards at Sugar beach today. <br>
    Fixing bugs on site. Things seem to work on Chrome now...but slideshow fading doesn't work on Safari and site is slow on Firefox.  Do I care?

    <a href="../trails/lipoaloop.html">Lipoa Loop</a> trail is official open, so of course I did a quick loop this morning. Have to go back when it's light and get pictures of some of the (fun) signs they've put up.<br>
    Got image transitions working on canvas; need to incorporate into the main site. Also, don't know how to integrate video into that scheme, as it seems CORS will still block things. Guess I'll leave video on an iframe, and only worry about image transitions for now.

    Tracked down that Oanapuka is...nothing :) Write up is <a href="../trails/oanapuka.html">here</a>.<br>
    Also got a long way down the road to implementing a cool image transition scheme in javascript/canvas, only to learn that (of course) they don't allow what I was trying to do for CORS. Need to abandon that and try again. Sigh.

    Total lunar eclipse early this morning; didn't get any good pictures, but what was amazing was that the moon was so dim (orange) that the surrounding stars were brilliant. Brilliant.<br>

    Kalepolepo to Sugar Beach - Yesterday was not glass...today was.  <br>
    Skipped a lot of choral; 20+ skips sometimes as no wave interference today <br>
    Thousands of small fish (Lens says Silver-stripe round herring) washed up on the beach; strange <br>
    Practiced narrow step walking, assuing that compensates for cross-slope effort on the beach?? <br>
    Young Hihimanu ray on Keawakapu; no tail to speak of. <br>

    Did the NorthEast Lahaina-Pali trail for the first time. 90 min roundtrip / 80 min moving time without pushing it.<br>
    Met George from Maui Hikes at the top...potential partner for Kaupo Gap? <br>
    Short write up on the <a href="../trails/lahainapali.html">trail</a>; should add more pictures at some point. <br>
    Thinking about hiking efficiency the whole way. Uphill is elevation/slope optimization; downhill is about minimizing acceleration? Worth a write up at some point.<br>
    Did a small bit of the old Lahaina road, which intersects Lahaina-Pali at the trailhead. It's interesting, but noisy (from the road) and probably not worth doing fully.

    Up early and headed to La Perouse Bay. Walked up Puʻu o Kanaloa as well as Puʻu Kalua o lapa. <br>
    Beautiful morning, 76F. Surprise was the clear view of the Big Island from Kanaloa. <br>
    Start at La Perouse near the gate, head into the lava fields to avoid the 'private' Makena Trail Rides area. <br>
    Then, work your way back North until you hit a wide trail. This will take you to both Puʻu easily. <br>
    There are lots of dry creek crossings, so easy to confuse the trail with creekbeds.
