    Did the NorthEast Lahaina-Pali trail for the first time. 1.5 hr up and back without pushing it.<br>
    Met George from Maui Hikes at the top...potential partner for Kaupo Gap? <br>
    Short write up on the <a href="../trails/lahainapali.html">trail</a>; should add more pictures at some point. <br>
    Thinking about hiking efficiency the whole way. Uphill is elevation/slope optimization; downhill is about minimizing acceleration? Worth a write up at some point.<br>
    Did a small bit of the old Lahaina road, which intersects Lahaina-Pali at the trailhead. It's interesting, but noisy (from the road) and probably not worth doing fully.

    Did a bit of research on <a href="../things/clouds.html">clouds</a>. Fun to refresh myself from high school.

    Went for a walk; Lipoa to new Hilton. Very high tide; no beach most of the way. <br>
    Clouds gathered on Haleakala in under 15 min - from clear to fully cloaked.

    Up early and headed to La Perouse Bay. Walked up Puʻu o Kanaloa as well as Puʻu Kalua o lapa. <br>
    Beautiful morning, 76F. Surprise was the clear view of the Big Island from Kanaloa. <br>
    Start at La Perouse near the gate, head into the lava fields to avoid the 'private' Makena Trail Rides area. <br>
    Then, work your way back North until you hit a wide trail. This will take you to both Puʻu easily. <br>
    There are lots of dry creek crossings, so easy to confuse the trail with creekbeds.
