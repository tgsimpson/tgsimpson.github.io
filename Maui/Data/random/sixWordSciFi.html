	<h1> Six Word SciFi </h1>

	<p> Inspired by Wired Magazines Sep 2022 issues, where they challenged readers to "In six words, write a story about a galaxy far, far away." <p>

  <p> Their best entries were (first one was the winning one): </p>

  <p>
    You turned <em>left</em> at Sirius B?!  <br>
    42 was definitely not the answer. <br>
    Dear humans, nobody wants unsolicited nudes. <br>
    Humans! There goes the dang neighborhood.<br>
    Is this DC's or Marvel's Universe? <br>
    "The robots are BLEEDING!" she screamed.<br>
    Directions to transdimensional left luggage office? <br>
  </p>

  <p> So, of course, I had to attempt some of my own: </p>

  <p>
    Who gave humans the remote control? <br>
    We turned out, despite the humans.<br>
    Reboot 1097. Success. Earth without Trump.<br>
    Year 4026. Humans finally potty trained.<br>
    Milky Way News: Human remains found.<br>
    Those you ignore history, were humans.<br>
    Decoded Voyager I. No useful information.<br>
    We evolved from four limbed mammals?<br>
    Radiation nominal. Archeologists allowed on Earth.<br>
    Earth had dry land? No way!<br>
    Robot found still running HumanOS 72.396.<br>
    New zoo exhibit. Real live humans!<br>
