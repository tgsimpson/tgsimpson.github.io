<h1> Keawalai Church, and a gift from Go...ogle </h1>

<p> This little United Church sits on a beautiful coastal lot in Makena, nestled amoungst the 11 digit houses and the new Makena Golf Course condos (starting at over $5M). The plot was bought, but the church for $80 in 1832. Based on inflation alone, that is $2,671 of today's dollars. Obviously something other than inflation has happened here; the lot itself is probably worth $10M+</p>

<p> But, that's not the point. The point is, something of a miracle happened at this church in 2022.</p>

<p> It was a beautiful day and we had just checked out Maluaka beach. Parking is sparse for this beach, at least on the North side, but we got lucky and found a spot. It's a small beach, but the sand is almost perfect and the views of Molakai are stunning. </p>

<p> Heading home we saw the church and decided to stop and take a look. The building itself was closed, but the little graveyard in the back is accessible and sometimes it's interesting to take a look at who's buried where. Having walked some of the famous cemetaries in Paris and Rome, this one was...underwhelming. Although not many cemetaries have a view like this one. </p>

<p> As you know, I worship windmills (not), and they are perfectly framed here. Perhaps I should wax eleqouently about how the two palm trees are reflective of prayer hands, framing the scene in some godly way? </p>

<p> But, we were in for a bit of a surprise. There was one well maintained grave, with lava rock sides, and the following plaque: </p>

<img class="Nimg" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEXCHqcQNkO7QRcuBCRvZa2AKT4TkTOo2TTUmOzhI3YXATCH0ygoTgq0Vb5TviOBiQspyrpmXKTe3HX-AC7ngftjmO1Ix82nVGwNUZRRBgMJ8RG4661ZiixEstyUVbnNydvBI5dKYcuMATUHKFfVvj0qLg=w1187-h1580-no">

<p> I'll admit, I burst out laughing, much to the surprise of the other couple that was looking around the graveyard. Dirty looks. But, read it. Here they were honoring something truly important, native Hawaiian heritage, and there is a huge call-out to the person who said a little prayer over the proceedings. Just struck me as funny that he got, and perhaps demanded, equal billing. It was 1975's equivalent of a troll tweet. Perhaps, in 1971, it wasn't yet obvious the horrendous toll that the Christian missionaries had subjected Hawaii to, so that a descendent of that Christian tradition felt they needed their name carved in stone.</p>

<p> Also at the Church is a beautiful Octopus Tree. Another mixed messsage, in a different way. Over the years the Church has been lovingly refurbished, rebuilt and reinvigorated. In recent decades that has involved using native materials whenever possible. But outside, hanging beautifully over the scene, is an invader. The Octopus Tree is an aggressive imported spieces, known to kill off native plants and depleat the soil. I love contradictions like this. </p>

<p> Back to the recent miracle. Later that day my wife noticed that her watch (fitbit) was missing; it was no-where to be found. Luckily we had taken some photos under the Octopus tree, and the timesstamps on the photos were within ten minutes of the last bluetooth sync. Sure enough, we came back the next morning and the watch was nestled under the Octopus tree, waiting for us. A second coming, of sorts. Enabled by Google.</p>
