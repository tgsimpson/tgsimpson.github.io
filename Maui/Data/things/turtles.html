	<h1> Green Sea Turtles </h1>

	<p> Wikipedia, as always, has a good background on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_sea_turtle">Green Sea Turtles</a>. </p>

	<ul>
	<li> Turtles are reptiles; they are four-legged vertebrates with a cold-blooded metabolism and scales covering their body. </li>
	<li> Turtles breath air, but sea turtles can hold their breath for a long time (several hours) if they are relatively inactive. The more active they are, the more they need to breach (obviously). They cannot breath underwater, and must surface (again, obviously). </li>
	<li> In Hawaii Green Sea Turtles bask - they come to shore at night to regulate their temperature; they are endothermic. Hawaii is the only place they seem to do this consistently, perhaps because the water and air temperature are very close? Usually males don't bask at all, but they do in Hawaii. Global warming may impact this; why turtles bask in Hawaii is not fully <a href="https://h-mar.org/hawaiis-sea-turtles-common-questions-easy-solutions/"> understood.</a></li>
	<li>It's estimated that between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 hatchlings survive. Hatchings occur all year round, but are concentrated in the summer months. After using their temporary tooth to break out of their shells, hatchlings usually make the trek from beach to ocean at night.</li>
	<li> It takes 20-30 years for a turtle to reach maturity, and then females may lay eggs until they are 80 years or older.</li>
	<li> Hatchlings start out 2-3" long and grow to three feet and over 300 lbs. </li>
</ul>

<p> We were in Lahaina mid-December and I did a quick snorkle at Baby Beach. As I've written before, this is about as easy a snorkeling spot as you can get. As well as the usual fish, I saw a beautiful box fish, a well hidden rockfish....and turtles mating.  The mating video is below; the quality is not great as it was a bit murky.

 <p> There are many reports of 'aggressive' behavior by both males and females when mating; this instance seemed almost the opposite. Not only was it 'gentle', but the two spent a long time together post-act - seemingly resting together. Interestingly, females may store sperm for several months before fertilization. When she is ready the female will 'nest' - dig a hole in the beach and lay her eggs; typically 80-120. She covers the nest with sand and leaves it. She will not return to help the hatchlings, about 60 days later, make it to the ocean - they are on their own. Why some beaches are used for nesting, while nearby ones may be ignored, is not fully understood.  </p>
