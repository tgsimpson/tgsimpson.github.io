	<h1> See Glass? </h1>
<p>
Brown, clear, transparent. Peons.<br>
Amber, green. Lower middle class.<br>
Pink, aqua, cobalt, amethyst. Upper middle.<br>
Turquoise, red, yellow, black, teal. Elite.<br>
But orange. Nothing rhymes with orange. <br>
The rarest of the rare. Top echelon.<br>
</p><p>
Orange that’s been through the wringer.<br>
Orange that’s old and worn.<br>
Lost its sheen; opaque.<br>
No rough edges left. <br>
Orange that’s forgotten it’s ancestry.<br>
That orange. That orange is Queen.<br>
</p><p>
& Amberina is the Queen amongst queens.<br>
By definition a centurion.<br>
Rarely washed up; rarely seen.<br>
If sighted, count your blessings,<br>
And she may return the favor.<br>
But definitely pick her up.<br>
Oh, the things she’s seen.<br>
But she’s tired and she’e earned it.<br>
</p><p>
And yet, from brown to orange.<br>
From the peons to the Queen.<br>
They’re all garbage. Waste. Refuse.<br> 
Broken, thrown, ignored. Cast adrift.<br>
The odd one, perhaps, with a message,<br>
Striving to reach another shore.<br>
And yet, still trash.<br>
</p><p>
But what trash, what treasure.<br>
If the tides and wind and sand have had their say.<br>
And scratched their way in,<br>
Ground their way around,<br>
Pummeled and tumbled and stirred.<br>
Mother Nature has had her say.<br>
And added the value which only she can.<br>
</p><p>
The Queens, the Elite, perhaps the upper middle.<br>
Grace necks and wrists and side tables.<br>
Adorn lights and windows and mirrors.<br>
And, as always the lower class and the peons,<br>
Gather together, in vases and jars,<br>
Showing the beauty of community,<br>
Some still sharp; many transparent to a fault.<br>
A cacophony of reflected light.<br>
</p><p>
When any of them catch your eye.<br>
Stop, bend, gather, treasure.<br>
For while you search for Amberina,<br>
Remember that you are, simply, collecting trash.<br>
</p>
