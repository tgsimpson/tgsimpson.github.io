	<h1> See Glass? </h1>
<p>
Brown, clear, transparent. Ah, peons.<br>
Ample green, splash of amber. Signs of the middle class.<br>
Amethyst, touch of pink, aqua, cobalt. Adorn the upper few.<br>
Turquoise, red, yellow, black, teal. Enter the elite.<br>
But orange? The rarest of the rare.<br>
Nothing rhymes with orange. <br>
</p><p>
Orange thats been through the wringer.<br>
Orange thats old and worn.<br>
Lost its sheen; opaque.<br>
No rough edges. No shards. <br>
Orange thats forgotten it’s ancestry.<br>
That orange? That orange is Queen.<br>
</p><p>
And Amberina is the Queen amongst queens.<br>
By definition a centurion.<br>
Rarely washed up; rarely seen.<br>
If sighted, count your blessings,<br>
And she may return the favor.<br>
Yes, definitely pick her up.<br>
Oh, the things she’s seen.<br>
She’s tired and she’s earned it.<br>
</p><p>
And yet, from brown to orange.<br>
From the peons to the Queen.<br>
They’re all garbage. Waste. Refuse.<br> 
Broken, thrown, ignored. Cast adrift.<br>
The odd one, perhaps, with a message,<br>
Striving to reach another shore.<br>
And yet, still trash.<br>
</p><p>
But what trash, what treasure.<br>
If the tides and wind and sand have had their say.<br>
And scratched their way in,<br>
Ground their way around,<br>
Pummeled and tumbled and stirred.<br>
Mother Nature has had her say.<br>
And added her unique value.<br>
</p><p>
The Queens, the elite, even the upper middle,<br>
Grace necks, ears, wrists and side tables.<br>
Adorn lights and windows and mirrors.
Proudly displayed as individuals.<br>
And, as always, the lower class and below,<br>
Gather together, in clunky vases and jars,<br>
Some still sharp; many transparent to a fault.<br>
A cacophony of reflected light.<br>
Showing the beauty of community.<br>
</p><p>
If any catch your eye,<br>
Stop, bend, gather, treasure.<br>
For while you search for Amberina,<br>
Remember that you are, simply, collecting trash.<br>
</p>

<p>
Beach / Sea glass follows a scale, based on how worn / old it is.
</p><p>
Beach glass is 'found at the beach', which is a pretty low bar; it may be very fresh (sharp edges, filled with beer last night) or slightly worn (dull edges, but still transparent).
</p><p>
Sea glass is opaque; it has spent enough time in mother nature's washing machine that it is worn smooth.  Sea glas, obviously, is more valuable than just beach glass.
</p><p>
 I've put this note, geographically, near Lahaina for two reasons. (1) You are more likely to find sea glass in an 'old' location where glass was thrown away, dumped off ships years and years ago. Lahaina, being the center of the whaling industry, has that attribute. (2) We were on baby beach after the 2022 storm 'Darby' and literally picked up a pound of glass - competing to get pieces with others doing the same. Most of it was beach glass, but there was some good sea glass as well. We have been back many times since - at low tide, after larger waves - and glass has been few and far between.
