	<h3> See Glass? </h3>
<p>
Brown, clear, transparent. Ah, peons.<br>
Ample green, splash of amber. Signs of the middle class.<br>
Amethyst, touch of pink, aqua, cobalt. Adorn the upper few.<br>
Turquoise, red, yellow, black, teal. Enter the elite.<br>
But orange? The rarest of the rare.<br>
Nothing rhymes with orange. <br>
</p><p>
Orange thats been through the wringer.<br>
Orange thats old and worn.<br>
Lost its sheen; opaque.<br>
No rough edges. No shards. <br>
Orange thats forgotten it’s ancestry.<br>
That orange? That orange is Queen.<br>
</p><p>
And Amberina is the Queen amongst queens.<br>
By definition a centurion.<br>
Rarely washed up; rarely seen.<br>
If sighted, count your blessings,<br>
And she may return the favor.<br>
Yes, definitely pick her up.<br>
Oh, the things she’s seen.<br>
She’s tired and she’s earned it.<br>
</p><p>
And yet, from brown to orange.<br>
From the peons to the Queen.<br>
They’re all garbage. Waste. Refuse.<br> 
Broken, thrown, ignored. Cast adrift.<br>
The odd one, perhaps, with a message,<br>
Striving to reach another shore.<br>
And yet, still trash.<br>
</p><p>
But what trash, what treasure.<br>
If the tides and wind and sand have had their say.<br>
And scratched their way in,<br>
Ground their way around,<br>
Pummeled and tumbled and stirred.<br>
Mother Nature has had her say.<br>
And added her unique value.<br>
</p><p>
The Queens, the elite, even the upper middle,<br>
Grace necks, ears, wrists and side tables.<br>
Adorn lights and windows and mirrors.
Proudly displayed as individuals.<br>
And, as always, the lower class and below,<br>
Gather together, in clunky vases and jars,<br>
Some still sharp; many transparent to a fault.<br>
A cacophony of reflected light.<br>
Showing the beauty of community.<br>
</p><p>
If any catch your eye,<br>
Stop, bend, gather, treasure.<br>
For while you search for Amberina,<br>
Remember that you are, simply, collecting trash.<br>

<p>
Beach / Sea glass follows a scale, based on how worn / old it is.
</p><p>
Beach glass is 'found at the beach', which is a pretty low bar; it may be very fresh (sharp edges, filled with beer last night) or slightly worn (dull edges, but still transparent).
</p><p>
Sea glass is opaque; it has spent enough time in mother nature's washing machine that it is worn smooth.  Sea glass, obviously, is more valuable than just beach glass.
</p><p>
 You are more likely to find sea glass in an 'old' location where glass was often thrown away, dumped off ships years and years ago. Lahaina, being the center of the whaling industry, has that attribute. We were on Lahaina's Baby Beach after the 2022 storm 'Darby' and literally picked up a pound of glass - competing to get pieces with others doing the same. Most of it was beach glass, but there was some good sea glass as well. We have been back many times since - at low tide, after larger waves - and glass has been few and far between.
</p>
<p> Sea glass is becoming harder to find. Less containers are glass nowadays, and rules against littering are stronger. </p>

<h3> Elusive </h3>

<p> 
A pause reflective steals away the light <br>
A single glimpse of the beauty within<br>
Overturns the drive to stride with haste alight<br>
Lest that glance dissolve to memory again<br>
<br>
Silent now standing senses attuned<br>
Watching intently for a glint, a flash<br>
Amoung the hoards of uninspired marooned<br>
Upon the shores unexpected did crash<br>
<br>
Not waiting quietly for the lazy hand<br>
Rather fighting the currents and the surf<br>
Mixing tumbling hidden then touching land<br>
Staying camouflaged amoungst the scurf<br>
<br>
This elusive active dance of wave<br>
Makes this sea glass a higher form of crave<br>

<div style="text-align: center">
Take salty water <br>
Add a vigorous sand stir <br>
Watch sea glass emerge <br>
<br>

Once a vessel<br>
Now thouroughly mixed up<br>
Found a way to shore<br>
<br>

Once sand heated high<br>
From glass to shard to seaside<br>
Now returns to sand<br>
<br>

There was a lass from Hawaii <br>
Who threw a bottle with glee <br>
In pieces it embraced the ocean <br>
Spent ages rocking with motion <br>
Then emerged most opaquely <br>
<br>

Hi ho and a bottle of rum <br>
Made the sailor completely numb <br>
Overboard she went <br>
Her contents spent <br>
A double example of dumb <br>
<br>

There was a lad most crass <br>
Who reveled in breaking bottles with his ass <br>
He'd give the girls what they please <br>
By giving his cheeks a good squeeze <br>
Thank god the sea washed that glass<br>

From sand<br>
Fierce fire forged glass<br>
Human habits had their harried way<br>
Brazenly broken bottles brave the sea<br>
Water washes well the wonton waste<br>
Salty sand scratches surfaces so<br>
Glass grinds and grates until<br>
Returning recycled and renewed<br>
To sand<br>
