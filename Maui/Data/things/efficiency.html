<h1> Trail Walking/Jogging/Running Efficiency </h1>

<h3> Work in progress </h3>

<p>** I may have opened up a can of worms; there is an enormous amount of literature on this topic...although nothing I can find directly related to 'route option on rugged terrain.' I may be refining this one for a while. ** <br>
  ** Ah - MCOT (the metabolic cost of tranport) may be the field we need... ** <br>
</p>

<p> My favorite exercise is trail walking / running, usually on fairly rough terrain. Often I find myself wondering if I'm being efficient, by which I mean using the least amount of energy. I'm sure there is all kinds of science behind this question, and I'll reference what I find here. However, I'm going to start out with pure speculation: </p>
<p> 
<em>Regardless of going uphill, flat, or downhill, you want to minimize acceleration of (1) your center of mass **, (2) of your feet and (3) your tendons / muscles.</em>
</p>
<p>** You naturally have a 'pendulum' motion (actually a curtate cycloid) from walking which is more effcient than trying to keep your center of mass completely still (thanks evolution). This is both up-down and side-to-side due to hip rotation and general mechanics (<a href="https://musculoskeletalkey.com/human-walking/">here</a>). So, for (1) we want to subtract out that natural motion and not include it in the thesis. Trying to minimize that natural motion will actually increase your energy use.</p>



<p> I'm going to look into the science to see if this is supported, but first a bit more detail on the speculation. I'll asssume that you want to travel at a reasonable pace. Obviously, sitting on a rock and taking infinite time to complete a hike uses very little energy; it's also not very productive.</p>

<p>
Acceleration is a change in speed or direction. So, changes in acceleration include going faster or slower, but also changing your angle of accent or descent, moving left or right, etc. If you could do a hike in a perfectly straight line at a constant incline with no need to raise your foot higher than the next step requires, you would be minimizing your overall acceleration. If, on such a route, your muscles and tendons contract and extend the least possible to move you, that also minimizes acceleration. Simply thinking of acceleration as 'change,' you want to minimize the number of changes you make.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Stepping over, versus around, rocks.</li>
  <li> Taking larger vertical step versus several smaller verticals. </li>
  <li> Walking on a sloped beach; narrow your gait to compensate? </li>
  <li> Running switchbacks; clean arcs at the corners (longer route, maintain speed) or sharp turns (shorter, lose speed) </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In all of these situations, given your brain expends a lot of energy, are you better to simply let your animal brain (lower energy use) make the decisions...or is the energy used in higher thinking functions (lots of neurons firing) offset by the gains realized from smarter decisions? Let's try to put this one to bed. According to <a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/brain-anatomy-and-function/anatomy/2019/how-much-energy-does-the-brain-use-020119"> this </a>, the brain uses about 20% of your energy, but it's energy use does not change very much based on what you are thinking. Most of that brain energy goes towards maintenance of the brain, not higher or lower processing functions. In fact, with very high concentration tasks (those red areas in an fMRI) your brain energy only goes up by 8%, to 21.6% of total energy use. In the meantime, muscle energy can chhange by a factor of three or four, between sitting still and moving aggresssively. So, it is almost certain that <em>if</em> you can make better decisions about your hiking by concentrating on it, that energy will be more than offset by efficient muscle usage.
</p>

<p> Basics from what I've read so far... Nothing that completely refutes my thesis, but lots more work to do.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Changing speed and changing direction do have a metabolic cost. </li>
  <li> Two studies below are counterintuitive. One shows that sprints with stops/starts are more efficient than straight line sprints. The other shows that climbing single steps is less efficient than double steps.  My thesis on both of these: they <em>don't include time</em> in their analysis. For the sprints, it takes longer to do 100M in 10M segments. Even taking into account resting metabolism after a straight line sprint, I expect the energy/time will be higher for the stops/starts. Since I'm most interested in longer ventures, perhaps I need to look at energy/30 minutes, versus energy in very small time periods> </li>
  <li> Very interesting work that indicates a 30 degree incline is the most efficient (for speed) slope. </li>
</ul>

<p> I'm starting to think that this is very individual. Perhaps the best path forward for me is to simply monitor my auto-responses as I'm walking/running. Your brain should already be optimizing for efficiency (??), so perhaps any override we do by thinking is actually harmful? I'm sure, like me, you have times when you are thinking of something completely different from your hike, and find yourself quite a ways up or down without really thinking about it. I need to record those moments and then analyze them? </p>

  Energy used grows linearly with speed over a wide range of speeds. While foot-down time decreases the faster you move, there is a related increase in the muscle usage to drive the next step. Oversimplification: A slow walk is activing muscles 100% of the time, but at a force of X. Running very fast you muscles may only be actived 5% of the time, but at 20X the force.

  Counter to my thesis. Sprints with a change of direction have lower cost than straight line sprints. Their argument is that deceleration is cheaper than acceleration, so the deceleration phase actually saves energy. Despite that, two major muscles are shown to have to work significantly harder (which is intuitive). Not sure I get this article; needs another read or two. This paper purports to refute several other studies, including the one below. <br>
  I think the authors miss an important factor - time. Because the runs with CoD take longer, the straight line runs should be extended (with some recovery energy still being used) to get the total expenditure over the same time period. This does not, however, refute this completely for my use case here, as we aren't really worried about time...if a hike takes a bit longer but uses less energy, so be it.

  We all have a natural gait, and it is our most efficient; however, small fluctuations don't have a large impact. "The current study aimed to characterize the interaction between net MCOT and step-to-step variability while walking at different speeds. The amount of step length variations was linearly associated with MCOT, likely because increases in variations are indicative of a higher occurrence of metabolically suboptimal steps. The step length fluctuations were not predictive of changes in net MCOT. This indicates that the persistence of fluctuations likely does not function to reduce MCOT. Despite its potential to reduce MCOT, step length variations were not minimized at the PWS but were at fast walking speeds, where they may be reduced in order to mitigate the increased MCOT due to increased walking speed."

  "The present study findings indicate that (1) treadmill-calibrated heart rate recordings can be used as a valid alternative to respirometry to ascertain rate of energy expenditure during stair climbing; (2) two step climbing invokes a higher rate of energy expenditure; however, one step climbing is energetically more expensive in total over the entirety of a stairway. Therefore to expend the maximum number of calories when climbing a set of stairs the single-step strategy is better."

  "the metabolic cost of walking can largely be explained by the linear combination of four costs—swing and torso dynamics, center of mass velocity redirection, ground clearance, and body weight support" ... Good article, this one. "...postulated that all these determinants are the result of body’s best effort to flatten and smoothen the CoM trajectory, i.e. minimizing accelerations10. To the contrary, numerous studies have identified the energetic benefits of non-flat pendular dynamics of the CoM due to potential energy and kinetic energy exchange11. These simple inverted pendulum walking models demonstrate that no work is needed during each step."  This supports subtracting out the natural pendulum motion on your CoM.

  "As compared with 0% inclined treadmill gait, the 10% inclined treadmill gait increased the net cardiopulmonary metabolic energy cost by 22.9%, while the 16% inclined treadmill gait increased the net cardiopulmonary metabolic energy cost by 44.2%."  I'm having trouble finding a paper showing if incline impacts energy at more than linear. This experiment would imply so. First 10% increased energy by 2.29% per degree of incline, vs 3.55% in the next 6%. This is closer to exponential than linear.
