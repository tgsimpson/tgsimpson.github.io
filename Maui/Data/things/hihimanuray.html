	<h1> Hihimanu Ray </h1>
  <p>Oct 3, 2022</p>

	<p> Keawakapu is a beautiful 'strolling' beach. People all along, but never packed. </p>

  <p> Today the wave energy was medium; two to three foot waves, arriving every fifteen seconds. After a good swim we walked south to dry off and enjoy the day. At the very south end of the beach a large (well, about fifteen people) crowd was gathered, pointing at the water and snapping photos. "Tourists seeing their first turtles," I joked. Most days, swimming here, you see at least one green turtle, and often many more. But, as we got closer we realized how wrong I was. These were rays; three of them. </p>

  <p> Here are a couple of public images of these magnificent beasts. </p>

  <p> The ones we spotted were close to shore; within twenty feet of the beach, and at most two feet of water depth. As the waves came they were silhoutted in the crest, and 'flew' beautifully through, never in danger of being swept to land. There were three of them.</p>

  <p> "Mating," commented one of the onlookers. "Two males and a female." Now that I looked closer I could see that both comments were true. The female was much larger than the the males - she was about five feet, fin-tip to fin-tip (wingspan), with a six foot tail. The males were maybe three feet wide with much shorter tails. </p>

  <img class="Wimg" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEVw1WXJxn2J66Jf_sYbfmOsPeXxJlkHe5RZ33OYKgLhqmDlx4_r4mR9hDuwlxnmYe8Jat9NoaTD6Glb2PLbmiFP0Hm-UJYpsNPI6nJuqu5VBcbw7Xgnz55NtvH0Mjd2CKbj5JrGxYWnVQFWU1RXTUd8jA=w2880-h1436-no">

  <p> The mating ritual was intricate. She would float peacefully, almost inviting attention, and then, when one of the males approached (carefully, respecting her tail), she would crest quickly, flapping her wings aggressively and rejecting the approach. If successful the male with use his mouth as a suction cup and attach himself to the females back; if he gets that far she may allow him to progress and move to a belly-to-belly formation to consumate the deal. As the waves ebbed and flowed, this dance was happening in as little as a foot of water and almost seemed orchestrated to the waves passing through. This is late in the usual breeding season (typically April through September), so we were doubly lucky to stumble upon them today.</p>

  <p> Having just done our own swim, we didn't have our phones (cameras) with us. I was entranced, standing knee deep in the surf with the rays almost within touching distance. When one of the tails got too close, I'd scurry back; wary of the barbs - although I didn't know, at the time, what type of rays these were, or how dangerous their tails could be. In hindsight, knowing rays main predators are sharks....those tails need to be impressive. </p>

  <p> Luckily, my wife is great at striking up conversations. In between telling me "get back, watch out!" she managed to get several people to send us the best pictures they'd snapped. The two images above, and the one below, come from them (thanks much).</p>

  <p> This ray, with the amazing patterns under the fin, is known by many names: hihimanu ray, hawaiian spotted eagle ray, bonnet ray, duck bill ray. Like many Hawaiian words, hihimanu seems to have multiple translations - lavish, beautiful, magnificent, or elegant bird. They all apply in this case. </p>

  <p> The hihimanu is not technically a sting ray, although the tail does have several sharp barbs closer to the body which can be very painful if touched. They are generally shy, and swim away from people when approached. On this day, however, they were not shy at all. Although there were multiple people in the water, they approached to within inches of us, perhaps so focused on the business at hand that their normal aversion was a secondary thought. </p>

  <p> At the other end of the reproductive cycle, these rays are known to leap and summersault out of the water giving birth in the process. The gestation period is twelve months, so while it's unlikely that these particular rays will return to Keawakapu early next October...you never know - I've put it in my calendar. A liter is usually one to four young, and the babies grow to be a reasonable size (ten+ inch wingspan) before they are birthed. The wings are tightly wrapped around their bodies, unfolding quickly to allow the young to swim and avoid predators within moments of emerging.</p>

  This is not a hihimanu....but you get the idea.</p>

  <p> Like most rays, these ones feed on snails, shrimp, and crab. Their 'beaks' hide hard plates used to seperate shell from flesh effeciently. Rays have, like sharks, two more senses than humans: electroreception and water-motion sense. The second is obvious; the first helps them find those shelled creatures buried in the sand.
