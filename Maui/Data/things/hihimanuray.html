	<h1> Hihimanu Ray </h1>
  <p>Oct 3, 2022</p>

	<p> Keawakapu is a beautiful 'strolling' beach. People all along, but never packed. </p>

  <p> Today the wave energy was medium; two to three foot waves, arriving every fifteen seconds. After a good swim we walked south to dry off and enjoy the day. At the very south end of the beach a large (well, about fifteen people) crowd was gathered, pointing at the water and snapping photos. "Tourists seeing their first turtles," I joked. Most days, swimming here, you see at least one green turtle, and often many more. But, as we got closer we realized how wrong I was. These were rays; three of them. </p>

  <p> They were close to shore; within twenty feet of the beach, and at most two feet depth. As the waves came they were silhoutted in the crest, and 'flew' beautifully through, never in danger of being swept to land. There were three of them.</p>

  <p> "Mating," commented one of the onlookers. "Two males and a female." Now that I looked closer I could see that both comments were true. The female was much larger than the the males - she was about four feet, fin-tip to fin-tip, with a six foot tail. The males were maybe three feet wide with much shorter tails. </p>

  <p> The mating ritual was intricate. She would float peacefully, almost inviting attention, and then, when one of the males approached (carefully, respecting her tail), she would crest quickly, flapping her fins aggressively and rejecting the approach. As the waves ebbed and flowed, this would be happening in as little as a foot of water, or coincide with the wave passing through. </p>

  <p> Having just swum, we didn't have our phones (cameras) with us. I was entranced, standing knee deep with the rays almost within touching distance. When one of the tails got too close, I'd scurry back; warry of the barbs - although I didn't know, at the time, what type of rays these were, or how dangerous their tails could be. In hindsight, knowing rays are eaten by sharks....those tails need to be impressive. </p>

  <p> Luckily, my wife is great at striking up conversations. In between telling me "get back, watch out!" she managed to get several people to send us the best pictures they had snapped.</p>
