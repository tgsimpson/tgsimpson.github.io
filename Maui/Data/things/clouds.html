<h1> Clouds on Maui </h1>

<p> These images were taken 10 minutes apart, at around 6AM. The view is from the new Hilton Grand Vacations Club Maui Bay Villas. What struck me was how Haleakala went from essentially no clouds to almost fully cloaked in that 10 minutes. Sure, clouds can form fast...but that was fast. </p>

<p> As you'll remember from school, clouds form when air rises - it cools, reaches the dew point, and water droplets condense. In Maui, and other island mountains, the air rises as winds blow up and over the mountain tops. If the mountain is high enough for the air to reach the dew point, clouds form; if it's not high enough, they don't form - the air flows up and over without water condensing. That's why Kaho‘olawe, which is only about 1,500', doesn't generate it's own clouds, and is reliant on the downwind effects of Haleakala for it's water. </p>

<p> Usually the higher you go into the atmosphere the cooler it gets, so clouds continue forming with altitude. In some cases, Haleakala being an example, there can be a warmer layer of air higher up. For Haleakala this warm air is brought in by the trade winds. When that occurs - the cooler air rising into a warmer layer - an inversion occurs and cloud formation stops. Because the trade winds sweep past Haleakala, the warm layer surrounds the mountain completely. This is why the cloud layer is usually from around 5,000' to 7,500' leaving the summit clear.

Reading the discruption above you'd almost expect a 'donut' cloud around Haleakala almost all the time, and that wouldn't be too far from the truth. But, of course, things are highly variable. Humidity, wind speed, air and ocean temperature all impact cloud formation. There are many times when Haleakala is completely clear, and times when you can have amazing cloud structures up in the crater, above the typical inversion level, as all the forces fight each other. Inside the crater is pretty dry and arid; while threatening clouds hang out in the east, they most often sweep around, versus over, the crater itself. </p>

<p> The West Maui mountains are not tall enough to create an inversion with the trade winds. That's why clouds there often grow higher and sweep over the top of the range. The depth of clouds corresponds linearly to the amount of water and rain, so there is often more water content over Pu'u Kukui than Haleakala.  This also explains why Kauai is very wet, where Kawaikini is a bit over 5,000'. </p>

<p> Experienced islanders can predict a lot about the weather simply from looking at the clouds. A good summary <a href="https://www.hawaiilife.com/blog/what-do-the-clouds-above-hawaii-tell-us/">here</a></p> 

<p> Alright - enough background. Back to the original question. How does Haleakala go from cloudless to fully cloaked in 10 minutes? It's no longer mysterious. The right increase in the wind, driving the cooler air up the windward side aggressively, with the right humidity levels and dew point, and the tradewinds at higher elevations pushing the clouds around the mountain. Simple, just don't blink and miss it. </p>

<p> You can see the science reflected in the rainfall map above. Red is 10-30 inches per year; Blue is 330-400 inches. In particular you can see how dry the central plains and south Maui (Kihei, Wailea, Makena) are. This is why there were massive projects to route water from the wettest areas of this map to the driest over the years. First to support sugarcane plantations, and then to support tourism. Water management and rights on Maui are complicated for this reason - areas of plenty (perhaps even excess) negotiating with arid regions. It's also a motivating factor for the traditional Hawaiian land management, ahupua'a, where land segments were wedges with the narrow end high in the (wet) mountains, and the wide end on the (often dry) shoreline.</p>

<p> Wai‘ale‘ale, which is adjacent to Kawaikini on Kauai is the wettest spot in Hawaii, getting over 450 inches of rain per year. That's a lot of rain!</p>
