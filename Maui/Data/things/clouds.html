<h1> Clouds on Maui </h1>

<p> These images were taken 10 minutes apart, at around 6AM. The view is from the new Hilton Grand Vacations Club Maui Bay Villas. What struck me was how Haleakala went from essentially no clouds to almost fully cloaked in that 10 minutes. Sure, clouds can form fast...but that was fast. </p>

<p> As you'll remember from school, clouds form when air rises - it cools, reaches the dew point, and water droplets condense. In Maui, and other island mountains, the air rises as winds blow up and over the mountain tops. If the mountain is high enough for the air to reach the dew point, clouds form; if it's not high enough, the don't - the air flows up and over without water condensing. That's why Kahoâ€˜olawe, which is only about 1,500', doesn't generate it's own clouds, and is reliant on the downwind effects of Haleakala for it's water. </p>

<p> Usually the higher you go into the atmosphere the cooler it gets, so clouds continue forming with altitude. In some cases, Haleakala being an example, there can be a warmer layer of air higher up. For Haleakala this warm air is brought in by the trade winds. When that occurs - the cooler air rising into a warmer layer - an inversion occurs and cloud formation stops. Because the trade winds sweep past Haleakala, the warm layer surrounds the mountain completely. This is why the cloud layer is usually from around 5,000' to 7,500' leaving the summit clear. Reading the discruption about you'd almost expect a 'pancake' of a cloud around Haleakala all the time. But, of course, things are highly variable. Humidity, wind speed, air and ocean temperature all impact cloud formation. You can have amazing cloud structures up in the crater as all the forces fight each other. </p>

<p> The West Maui mountains are not tall enough to create an inversion with the trade winds. That's why clouds there often grow higher and sweep over the top of the range. The depth of clouds corresponds linearly to the amount of water and rain, so there is often more water content over Pu'u Kukui than Haleakala.  This also explains why Kauai is very wet, where Kawaikini is a bit over 5,000'. </p>

<p> Experienced islanders can predict a lot about the weather simply from looking at the clouds. A good summary <a href="https://www.hawaiilife.com/blog/what-do-the-clouds-above-hawaii-tell-us/">here</a></p> 

<p> Alright - enough background. Back to the original question. How does Haleakala go from cloudless to fully cloaked in 10 minutes? It's no longer mysterious. The right combination of wind, driving the cooler air up the windward side aggressively, humidity levels / dew point, and the tradewinds at higher elevations pushing the clouds around the mountain. Simple, just don't blink and miss it. </p>
