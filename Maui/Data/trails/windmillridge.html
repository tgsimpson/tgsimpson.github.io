  <p>If you plan to walk up the Maui windmill ridge you should expect some wind. However, when the door on my car was wrenched out of my hand at 5AM by a large gust, I had second thoughts about heading out. This is usually the calmest time of the day.
But I've done this hike enough times to know that once you climb the first steep section you'll be on the leeward side of the ridge, west of the Pohakea Gulch, where it can be quite sheltered. When you reach that point, you may even hope for a cooling breeze while the wind thunders above you.</p>

  <p>It's July and hot, so I'm setting off before sunrise to beat the heat. A benefit is that youo witness dawn peeking over Haleakala, which will paint the central plain with early morning joy.  
This walk averages a twenty percent grade, with many sections being steeper, so one has to remember to stop, turn around, and enjoy the view once and a while. You might want to pack a cloth to wipe the sweat out of your eyes (and sunglasses) to enable that view. You are going to sweat.</p>

  <figcaption>Trail starts out steep (to jog)...and stays that way</figcaption>
</figure>

  <p>My route follows the access road for the power lines. This is not the Lahaina-Pali trail, which intersects the windmills at their midway point, but rather the 'road' which starts a hundred yards to the east of the Maalaea Lahaina-Pali parking lot. This trail winds its way up to the very topmost windmills. It's less rocky than Lahaina-Pali but steeper and longer.</p>
  <p>As one slogs towards the top glimpses of the windmills come into view. They are teasingly close and your mind says "just over the next rise and around the next bend." Don't be fooled. It's right around four miles to the top, and more importantly, over thirty-three hundred feet of vertical, with no breaks. The round trip will take two hours or so (although one time I was passed by some thirty-something super human who was running up the scree; if you are he, then ninety minutes).</p>

  <p>Once you pass that first steep section, and turn slightly west, the trail is largely sheltered from the wind; first by the shape of the ridge itself and later by the ever increasing bushes and trees. By the top third of the climb the sparse, dry, grassy terrain becomes a small forest. This is the opposite transition from what I'm used to; in the the Rocky Mountains you typically climb up out of the forest and into the open. Similar to some Rocky Mountain alpine meadow, at the top of this trail you'll be rewarded with pastoral fields, which have been used for cattle ranching.</p>
  <p>The wind also makes a transition as you climb, even it if it remains at a steady force. Starting out you listen to it howling through the grass. In the middle the power lines sing, hiss, and chirp - finding their harmonics. In the forested section the wind whistles through the trees, leaving behind those man-made frequencies and returning you to something more natural and primordial. That is, until you get close to the windmills themselves and hear their iconic artificial roars. It's a walk that gives you the full audio spectrum of the wind.</p>
  <p>When you get close to the top you're often rewarded with clouds and drizzle, as I was today. At this point the cool moisture may be exactly what you need.</p>

  <p>The trade-offs implicit in windmills are well known; on this trail those trade-offs are rendered in high relief.</p>

  <p>The trail is easy to follow; if ever in doubt, head uphill. You're almost at the top when you see some old cattle corral fencing. Don't be fooled by the clear view of the top windmill from here and head towards it...just head uphill. There is a barbed-wire fence near the top; when you hit it you're already above the highest windmill, albeit looking at the row from a bit off center. This is a reasonable spot to stop. If motivated head uphill once more for a final little coat-hook in the trail and you'll truly be directly above the line of mills.</p>

  <p>From here you get a good view of not only the windmills, but also the infrastructure that was required to install them. Access roads, concrete pads, power lines heading off in all directions.  The tradeoffs of windmill farms are well known, and this particular farm shows them in high relief. I wonder what this ridge was like when it was pristine.</p>

  <p>It's hard to imagine an eighteen wheeler driving up this ridge with the core tower of a windmill, each over 150 feet tall - not including the arms which add another 30 or more feet. The truck would be offloaded by a crane, and then turn around somehow in order to head back down. </p>
  <p>I looked around for signs of a turn-around spot and none was obvious. Given this part of the farm was installed over sixteen years ago, much of the construction road could have grown over and disappeared, although that seems unlikely given the light vegetation and lava rock in most of this area.</p>

  <p>Reading the history of Maui you'll be struck, as I have been, at the imperial forces (the UK, France, and USA mainly) and the impact they've had on the island. One of those impacts was the growth of the cattle industry and the related deforestation.  One side of this ridge is pretty barren, and I doubt it was impacted. But the eastern side, and the high meadows, may well have been cleared. I've seen the roads used for forestry, and they are bad... but they are nothing compared to the road that was built for these windmills. Hopefully all of that was included in the total value calculation.</p>

  <p>As I rounded the last hook in the trail and then made my way down towards the top windmill I fully expected to see a white and red sign saying ‘no trespassing’; it wasn’t there, but I could feel its spirit hovering in front of me. Having done the Lahaina-Pali trail often enough, the sanctity of the maintenance road was well known to me; it's very well marked lower down. I’ve been up here a few times, and I've never seen any 'official' people - I do see another hiker once and while, but not today. So, I wasn't too worried.</p>
  <p>“Hey,” a woman in a 4x4 which was only meters from where I entered the road startled me.  She'd been hidden from view until my last few steps. She leaned out the window and talked towards me, “This is a private road.” </p>
  <p>I actually only heard bits of that, and am extrapolating the rest, as the windmills are quite loud. She didn’t look angry or upset, so I edged closer so that we could hear each other. I had to assume she was here on official business, as there is a sturdy locked gate at the bottom end of the maintenance road, down near the McGregor Point Lighthouse, and she'd obviously driven up from there.</p>
  <p>“Sorry,” I said loudly, being very Canadian, but refraining from adding an ‘eh’ with an upward intonation. “Just hit the top of the trail and popped out here.” All innocent like, sweat streaming off me in rivulets.</p>
  <p>“It happens,” she replied, nicely enough, and in a quieter voice now that I was within a few feet. “You should stay off the road and away from the windmills.” </p>
  <p>“Will do,” I answered, not at all facetiously. “But,” I pressed my luck. “I understand the contract on these windmills runs out in a few years; do you know what the plan is?” I was hoping they would retire them and move to small safe nuclear, but I hadn’t been able to find out what the plan was by doing web searches.</p>
  <p>“No idea. Imagine it will just be renewed.” She seemed to be in a bit of a hurry, very un-island-like, so I reiterated that I’d stay off the road and she headed off. </p>
  <p>I headed back the way I’d come while she drove out of sight; she took the left hand fork at the seventh windmill down, the route back down to Highway 30.</p>
  <p>I intended to go a bit higher up the ridge today, and the small trail at the top of that final coat-hook was the easiest way to go, or so my scan of Google Maps implied. With luck I could get to 4600 feet or a touch higher - a peak called Hanaula - following what looked like an animal trail on the map. If I did get that high I’d also be less than four miles from Pu’u Kukui, one of the ten wettest places on Earth, with an annual rainfall of 364 inches; that’s very close to an inch a day, for those that are counting. For comparison, Vancouver gets well less than 100 inches a year. Implication: it's often cloudy and rainy up here.</p>
<p>I’d worked my way up above the windmills a few times, but had been defeated by the weather. If I was going to struggle all the way up there, I at least wanted to have a view. This time it was clear, and calm, and I fought my way up another mile or so. But, I still didn't get to the top; it wasn't obvious how to proceed. I'll do a bit more scouting, then give it another try.</p>
<p>Half way down I was rewarded with Haleakala peaking through the clouds. I'd read that the West Maui mountains, where I'm standing, are a million years older than Haleakala. At some point Maui, Lanai, Molokini, and Kaho'olawe where all a single island, but time has worn them down allowing the Pacific to divide them.</p>

<p>You get a sense of that age on this trail. The rock, as you get higher, seems the result of ages and ages of compression and erosion. Gone are any hints of lava or cinder cones.</p>
<p>These windmills are surely the tiniest blip on those larger timescales. A hundred years ago they were unthinkable (in their current form), and a hundred years from now they will be the subject of an archeologists exciting story of how they stumbled upon large concrete foundations and rusted hulking cylinders on a Maui ridge.</p>
<p>Through that lens I feel lucky to be experiencing these mills today. They may not be perfect - far from it - but they do represent something grand...even if only for a few decades.</p>
<p>Why are windmills white? They are by design: White reflects UV well, so the windmills age better. White is often hard to see from the ground, against the cloudy sky, but easy to see from the sky for pilots and birds. On the flip side, studies have shown that white structures attract more insects, which attract more birds and bats, which...well chop chop. The ideal color for an insect free windmill? Purple. I'm not sure if the analysis for these windmills considered all this, but here white causes the windmills to stand out - either  against a blue sky or a brown hillside.</p>
<p>I often rant about the downsides of windmills. Aesthetics, infrastructure, intermittent energy, wildlife.</p>
<p>Now, later in the day, looking down at the windmill ridge from Haleakala, and remembering that I'm looking back in time a million years across those short twenty miles, I'm more sanguine. Turning the other way to look at the stars, a more typical way of looking into the past, I imagine these windmills more as a point in time: a small forward step in human development, not even a blink of an eye in the progression of the earth, and invisible to the universe at large. Yet, if we do ever reach the stars, this example of human ingenuity will have been far more positive than negative.</p>
<p>Everyone should do the Lahaina-Pali trail. At the midway point you can look up the hill at phase I of the Kaheawa windmill farm, and looking downhill see phase II. You can see the infrastructure it took to build and now maintain these giants. You can dream of material throughput.</p>
<p>But I'd also encourage you to climb the power line access road to the top. It will give you even more perspective.</p>
