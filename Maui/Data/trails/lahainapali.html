	<h1> Lahaina Pali Trail </h1>

	<p> This trail is well documented in guide books, but worth a bit more of a write up, imho. While some may do the complete round trip (about 10 miles), and some may do one way (leaving a car at the other end, or getting picked up), I suspect most people do a "to the top and back" route. So, the question becomes, should you do the South West route, from Maalea, or the NorthEast route, from Papalaua?</p>

<p> First some basic stats... <br>
  - NorthEast route: 5 miles round trip, about 1600' vertical feet. Trip time: 42 min up, 23 min down.<br>
  - SouthWest route: 5 miles round trip, about 1450' vertical feet. Trip time: 47 min up, 26 min down.<br>
</p>
<p> So, not much to differentiate on based on that :) </p>
<p> Here are some other considerations... <br>
  - The NorthEast route is 'medium' about 75% of the way, 5% 'tough' and 'medium-easy' the rest. <br>
  - The SouthWest route is 'medium' about 50% of the way, 20% 'tough' and 'medium-easy' the rest. <br>
  The difference is not in steepness; the difference is in the rock. The NorthEast rock is less jagged and sharp. You can turn an ankle on either trail. Of course my medium-easy through tough is highly subjective; this is based on 'is it relatively safe to jog.' <br>
  - The NorthEast route can be done before sunrise, making it cooler. <br>
  - The SouthWest route gives you amazing sunrise vistas, making the views slightly better. <br>
  Like I always suggest, do either side early in the morning. <br>
  - The SouthWest route has more wind.<br>
  The NorthEast route hides behind the ridge, so is more sheltered. <br>
</p>

<p>
Finally, on the SouthWest route you get tantalizing views of the windmills when they are still far away. <br>
On the NorthEast trail you may hear the windmills before you see them :)
