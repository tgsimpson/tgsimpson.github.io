	<h1> Pu'u o Kali </h1>

	<p> Today's target is, perhaps, the most reconizable cone in South Maui - the very red Pu'u o Kali. </p>

		Pu'u-o-Kali: Quadrangle and hill (1,481 feet high), Ma'alaea qd., Maui, believed once a <em>mo'o</em>, the wife of nearby Pu'u-hele; their child, Pu'u-o-inaina (hill of wrath) was placed on Ka-ho'olawe and late was a lover of Pele's sweetheart, Lohi'au.  <em>Lit.</em> hill of waiting <br>

	<p>I looked at two approaches to the hill: (1) From below, starting at Maui Brewing and working my way up Waiohuli Gulch, or (2) From above, starting at Waiohuli Community Center. I ultimately decided on the second (there are a lot of no trespassing signs on the former). If I was to do it again, I'd probably start at Koapu'upu'u street. More on that later. </p>

	<p>Driving up from Kihei before dawn I hit a downpour around Pukalani, and almost turned back. This was a fastest mode on wipers, slow down and watch the side of the road, kind of downpour. But while my animal brain said turn, my frontal lobe reassured me that that rain on the wet side of Maui does not imply rain on the leeward side, so I kept on. </p>

	<p>The walk down from Waiohuli is pleasant. There is a gulch that needs to be crossed, and while not dangerous, picking a good spot is important. It is quite steep with loose rocks in some places. On the way back I got caught, for a few minutes, at a particularily steep section and had to work my way up the gulch to find a spot to cross. </p>
	<p> This is cattle country, and there are lots of trails forged by the herds. There are also a lot of axis deer, with their smaller trails through the rougher sections. I attempted a bit of a bee-line to Pu'u o Kali and ended up in some less-than-pleasent sections, where dead bushes with thorns were too thick to fully avoid (should have worn pants), but overall it is an enjoyable 1/2 hour to the pu'u. The two essential skills are: being able to climb over barb-wire fences, and not being scared of cows. Luckily I grew up in cattle country and had no problem with either. I did, however, go out of my way not to spook the cattle I saw in an attempt to be respectful. </p>

	<p> The cone is just as red as it looks, and quite pleasent to walk around. The views, both makai and mauka, are beautiful. The rain clouds behaved and stayed to the east. The sun was just rising, so the rainbow over Kaho'olawe was a pleasent surprise. </p>

	<p> On the way back up I startled a large herd of axis deer; as per usual I didn't have my camera handy enough, and they disappeared into the cactus.</p>

	<p> This is a short hike that is required 'because it is there.' That was an old joke when I was growing up. My dad would head out to conquer another peak, and my mom would ask 'why?' The answer never varied: because it is there. </p>
	<p> Back at Waiohuli I noted that it was set up for a wedding. What a location. Amazing views of Wailea through Kahalui, with the West Maui Mountains framed in the middle. On this morning there was also a rainbow to the east. </p>
	<p> The rainbows seemed to follow me. Here is a shot from around Makawao, and another once I was back in Kihei.</p>

	<p> Things to follow up on. I guess Pu'u o Kali is know for it's <a href="https://www.seacology.org/project/266-united-states/">wiliwili trees.</a>. I might have to go back when they flower. </p>
