	<h1> Seven Miles of Beach </h1>

  <h3> Longest beach walk on Maui </h3>

	<p> At low tide you can walk from Maalea Harbor to Waimahaihai almost completely on the beach. There are two spots where a tiny bit of land may be required, based on how low the tide is. The first is at the very beginning of the walk, right at Maalea Harbor (where you might have to 'trespass' on a couple of condo buildings seaside bluffs) and a small spot in front of the new Hilton Grand Vacations at Kaonoulu Street.</p>

  <p> This walk is beautiful at any time of the day, but per my usual habits I typically start just before dawn to avoid the sun. Jogging, with a few stops for pictures, this is probably a bit over an hour (depending on the beach slope), so you can be done before the sun peaks over Haleakala. </p>

  <p> As well as all the beaches (with pictures elsewhere), going south from Maalea gives you amazing views of the full scope of Haleakala, from Paia to Makena. There is something magical about a bi-furcated sunrise, wrapping around both edges of the mountain long before the top lightens completely. </p>

  <p> It's also nice to have the Windmills behind you the entire way, so that you can ignore them. It's a bit more difficult to ignore 'the tree' :) </p>
