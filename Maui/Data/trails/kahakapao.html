	<h1> Kahakapao </h1>

	<p> Just mauka (towards the mountain) from Makawao is the beautiful Kehakapao Loop trail, a six mile popsicle (stick plus loop) round trip. There is a combination of mountain biking and hiking in this area, but trails are well marked and cyclists well behaved (in my experience). The trail is in open forest and has no steep sections, making it ideal for strolling, striding, or running. This is our favorite upcountry walk - beautiful and easily accessible.</p>

<p>There are many upcountry walks in Maui, but this is one of the best. It's everything other walks in Maui are not. It has no views of the ocean or the mountains, it is usually 10-20 degrees cooler than the coast (fahrenheit, of course), it is calm even when the wind is whistling above â€¦ and it is beautiful in its own way. It reminds me of walks in the redwood forests of Northern California; there is very little undergrowth, lots of both native and introduced greenery, small forest animals and birds for the keen-eyed. In a word, it's as relaxing as a six mile walk can be.</p>

<p>And it gives you lots of time to think about this region of Maui, and some of the interesting goings-on that have occurred near here.</p>

<p>The bottom half of the trail has very little undergrowth. As you climb higher (the trail rises about 1000 feet overall) more ferns, flowers, and ground cover appear. The trail wanders back and forth, maintaining a shallow grade throughout; almost like it was designed for mountain biking.</p>

<p>This forest was not always like this. Going back several hundred years there was a lot more koa, wiliwil, kukui, and ulu trees. Given the name of this trail it's easy to imagine native Hawaiians climbing to this slope of Haleakala to find the perfect koa tree from which to build a canoe (or surfboard). </p>

<p> Koa has long been desired and valuable due to it's hardness and beautiful grain/pattern. It was historically reserved for ali'i (royalty) and building a canoe out of a single trunk was highly prized. Interestingly, koa is also the Hawaiian word for warrior. The relationship comes from the interpretation of warrior as bravery, defense, stewardship...as opposed to war. Koa seeds require adversity to sprout, and need to fight torrential winds and rain as they grow, while also protecting the environment, sheltering animals, and maintaining soil and water balance. They are truly warriors.</p>

<p>Between (1) the arrival or Europeans, who harvested koa for making furniture and musical instruments, (2) the growth of cattle ranches, which cleared large forested areas, and (3) infestations of the koa moth between 1900 and 1980, koa came close to being wiped out. Of almost 190,000 hectares on Maui, only about 3,500 now contain koa trees and much of that is due to reforestation efforts.</p>

<p>For me the easiest way to recognize koa trees is with their large seed pods; as part of the acacia family, they share that attribute with many trees...but there don't seem to be other acacia's in Kahakapao. Finding a kao large enough to carve a full canoe out would be a challenge. Adding to that challenge would be carving with an adze and transporting the result down to the coast. While the average canoe was 20-30 feet long, some were reported, by Cook, La Perouse and others, at close to 60 feet.</p>

<p>Choosing, designing, and carving a canoe involved many religious and spiritual steps, some of which were also highly practical. For example, a tree with a lot of elepaio birds (representing the goddess Lea) was rejected as this implied too many worms. The consecration ceremony (lolowaa) involved catching a single fish to offer to the god Kuula, which may have also been a good way to limit the canoes first outing in order to check its construction quality.</p>

<p>The preceding images show how clear a path the Kahakapao trail cuts. You will not get lost on this trail. Don't worry. However, <a href="https://www.abccolumbia.com/2019/05/25/yoga-teacher-found-alive-after-missing-for-2-weeks-in-hawaii-forest/"> Amanda managed to </a>. How is still a bit of a mystery. After setting out for a short walk, and leaving behind her cell phone, Amanda fell asleep on a log. When she awoke, she headed in the wrong direction (towards Twin Falls, it ends up) and continued to go in the wrong direction for seventeen days. She lost her shoes, survived on stream water, berries, and the aforementioned moths, and ultimately was rescued when a helicopter spotted her.
</p>
<p>
Ignoring some obvious questions, and assuming (aloha) that the entire incident was transparently accounted, what is amazing is that <em>you can survive for a long time on the slopes of Haleakala</em>.

You get that sense when walking the trail. This is a friendly place. No large animals to be wary of (other than humans on mountain bikes). No snakes. 
It's the kind of spot where you could lie down for a nap, without a bivouac sack. I almost succumbed to this desire. I remember a time, in the Rocky Mountains, where I slept in a sack and was awoken by a wolverine sniffing around on my legs - not my proudest moment as I screamed out for help. That's not happening here. 
</p><p>
I give Amanda the benefit of the doubt. This is a place that can lull you into complacency...and if you fall for it, you'll still likely survive. Likely. </p>
