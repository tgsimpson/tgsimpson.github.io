	<h1> Kaupo Gap </h1>

	<p> Planning.... </p>
	<p> Stacy at <a href="https://holoholomauitours.com/">Holo Holo</a> tours is supposed to be a good guide. </p>

  <p> Trailhead to top of Haleakala is 15 miles / 9000 vertical feet, in two segments:  (1) to Kaupo Gap is 6.3 miles / 5250 feet, so average 833'/mile of climb = 16% grade. (2) Kaupo Gap to top is 8.7 miles / 3570 feet = 8% grade. </p>

  <p> My Windmill Trail is 3.7 miles up / 3200 feet = 16% grade, so excellent training for Kaupo. Just the up-route on the Windmill Ridge is 60% of the length and elevation of the first segment. The up-route has been taking me 1.5 hours. Not sure I can sustain that pace, or that the Kaupo trail is as 'nice' as the Windmill Trail, but in theory that gets me to Kaupo Gap in under 3 hours. The second segment is much less steep...so assuming I'm worn out but can keep the same pace, it would be another 3 hours to the summit. Time for some breaks, etc. Leave at 5AM, be at the top by noon :) </p>
