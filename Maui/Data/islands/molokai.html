	<h1> Molokaʻi - The (un) Friendly Isle</h1>

	<p> "<del>Visit</del>, <del>Spend</del>, Go Home" </p>

	<p>This is a fairly common sign on Molokaʻi, and is a great reason to visit. Of course Molokaʻi has some amazing places to visit (more below) but it is really different than other Hawaiian islands in how it 'feels.' </p>

	<ul>
		<li> Unwelcome - lots of signage telling you to go home. </li>
		<li> Welcome - almost any interaction with a local will be friendly and accomodating, provided you arrive with respect and humility. The signs most likely represent a minority of people, and are directed to those who come with ego's and holier-than-though attitudes. </li>
		<li> Beautiful - of course all the Hawaiian islands are amazing, but each is also unique. The tall sea cliffs, combined with the low volcanoes (although still tall enough to generate clouds) and the green/red midlands give Molokai a unique feel. </li>
		<li> Serene - once you leave the signs behind, and especially on the western end of the island, you feel like you could just stop and enjoy Earth for a while, without worrying about anything. </li>
		<li> Decrepit - there are signs of decay on a lot of places (although the main roads are excellent). The old development on the eastern shore is an obvious example, but many parts of the island are rundown. </li>
		<li> Envy - the islanders have fought hard to maintain some semblance of Hawaiian culture and living. You can imagine this being a blissful life, far from the daily issues of modern society. </li>
		<li> Lost Opportunity - at the other end of the spectrum, some well managed development might make Molokaʻi even more magical. </li>
	</ul>

	<p> It's hard to summarize this feeling, but it is the tug-of-war between 'wow' and 'hmm' that make the island so interesting. It's well worth a visit. Very few people live on Molokaʻi (about 8,000) or visit (about 65,000 per year). Assuming visitors spend only a few days on average, that means you are probably one of less than a couple hundred of tourists that are on the island at any given time. </p>

	<p> We spent a full day on the island...and will definitely go back for more.</p>

	<p> Mokulele Airlines flies to Molokaʻi from Maui, and it's about a 20 minute flight time. As they leave out of the commuter terminal in Kahaluhi, you can arrive 20 minutes before the flight, and be in your rental car 10 minutes after arrival, making the entire trip close to an hour (depending on where you were on Maui). So, it makes a day trip very feasible. Our flight path out of Maui took us up the east coast of north Maui and then the northeast coast of Molokaʻi. Flying over Halawa park, with it's two moon-shaped bays, and then past the cliffs in the north presents dramatic scenery. Finally turning back south over Kalaupapa you see the large flat plateau between the East and West Molokaʻi volcanoes. Bright red soil with relatively lush vegetation - both natural and planted. </p>

	<p> Our car rental experience started the trend of super friendly interactions and great service on the island. They were cheerful, helpful, and efficient; one of the better rental experiences I've ever had. We headed towards Kaunakakai - the main town - to get breakfast at the Kanemitsu Bakery and Coffee Shop. The baked goods are excellent...the coffee less so. The town is neat and clean, but adds to the 'fifty years ago' feel of the island. It's like the 1970's frozen in time. In one shop I was strickly warned, by a women not wearing a mask, not to enter without a mask. I almost laughed at her, but just politely left. In other stores we were welcomed in with a warm Aloha and looked after diligently. </p>

	<p> From Kaunakakai we headed east to Halawa park. The drive is beautiful and slow. Murphy's beach is worth a quick stroll, but otherwise it's more about enjoying the scenery and the windy road. The Kanaha Rock Islet Seabird Sanctuary is visible for much of the drive, with Lanai and then Maui visible in the near distance as you travel east. The final stretch of road down into Halawa is beautifuly built, with a lava rock half-wall on the cliff side adding confidence to the drive. As you wind in and out you catch glimpses of Moa'ula Falls, which we hoped to hiked to. </p>

	<p> Halawa's two crescent beaches are lovely, with the southern one being great for a quick dip in the ocean. It's not visible from the parking lot, but is a three minute jaunte from the norther one. </p>

	<p> Maui Revealed indicated that the hike to Moa'ula Falls was litered with 'no trespassing' signs, and that it was one of the area of Maui County where you should respect those signs. Of course I figured that was an exageration and that we'd find a nice trail and do a quick hike. Turns out that, as always, Revealed was very accurate. We wandered around trying to find the trail without much luck. Unfriendly signs blocked each possible approach. We spotted some local kids and asked for directions. They were very nice and helpful, even guiding us through the first half mile on their ATV and then saying "follow the water pipe." We duly attempted that, tiptoeing through some native planting grounds and sweeping away the larger spider webs (some occuppied by large black and yellow spiders), but ultimately couldn't find a way up to the Falls. Ultimately we turned back and gave up. We would have had to cross some of the 'no trespassing' areas and decided that respect for the residents was more important than a couple visitors seeing another waterfall. </p>

	<p> A couple miles back up the road we stopped at a quaint yet modern store on the Pu'u O Holu Ranch and chatted with the woman in the store. She indicated that you needed a local guide to get to the falls, as they would know the residents and negotiate passage through their properties.  So, if you are set on getting to the falls, you should look into that. </p>

	<p> After a quick lunch back in Kaunakakai we headed to the Kalaupapa overlook. My main desire on Molokaʻi was to do the Kaluapapa trail down to the National Park (the old Hansen's / leprosy settlement). Unfortunately a recent storm had damaged part of the path and we were unable to do the trek. It remains on my bucket list. While nowhere near as good, the Kaluapapa overlook is stunning. Reading the history of the camp, trying to imagine those exciled to this piece of paradise (which was, I'm sure, not seen as such), and seeing the surrounding cliffs definitely added gravitas. </p>


	<p> The close by Ka Ule o Nanahoa (Phallic rock) is physically underwhelming, but the historical context gives another glimpse into Native Hawaiian culture. </p>

  <p> From the overlook we headed to Kepuhi Beach and the somewhat famous abondoned Kaluakoi villas. These run down, unihabitable, buildings are situated on an amazing overlook, close to the beaches. On any other island it would be a six-star resort. Here on Molokaʻi they represent the populations push-back against development and tourism. </p>

  <p> After some time at the beach we wandered into a couple of residents setting up horseshoes on the beach. They encouraged us to play a round and were friendly - almost like they were excited to see outsiders. Smelling of old liquour, with suspicous tracks on their arms, but great attitudes, they thumped us at a game. </p>

  <p> If Maui is slow, Molokaʻi is slow squared. And that's okay. We enjoyed our day immensely. Sure there was a constant tension on whether we were welcome or not - despite doing our best to be respectful. But just absorbing the geography and culture - the first being much like the other islands, the second being quite different - made for a great outing. </p>

  <p> I'll be back...as soon as the Kalaupapa Trails opens back up. </p>
