  <title>Yet another Beach</title>

	<h1> Puu Olai </h1>
	<p> "Little Beach", as Puu Olai is best known, is famous for being "clothing optional".</p>
	<p> Itʻs often hard to get pictures of popular beaches without people on them, and doubly so for this one, as I didnʻt want any (even marginal) adult content on the site.</p>
	<p> You get to Puu Olai by going to the north end of Big Beach and climbing over a small rise. This beach is quite small, and very well worn. On busy days it can be covered with people doing all manner of things. </p>
