	<h1> Along the King's Highway </h1>
	<p> I'm not quite sure why, but I've stumbled upon some interesting people in this area of Maui. Perhaps the further you get from the crowds, the more interesting the individuals?</p>
	<p> I'd planned to make a quick trip to Kanaio Beach this morning, as part of visiting all the beaches on the island. Kanaio is a bit over two miles down the King's Highway from the La Perouse Bay parking lot and the trail is pretty lava'ish.  However, I reached Kanaio quickly and decided I had time to explore a bit further down the coastline. Just south of Kanaio, on some actual sand (Kanaio is all rock), I saw an ATV and a woman diligently gathering things from the shoreline.</p>
	<p> I was moving along pretty well, so I just raced past her with a nod. She looked busy, regardless. Of course, going through my mind was "how did she possibly get here on an ATV?" There are big signs disallowing vehicles on the King's Highway. As I travelled further the answer became clear - sheʻd come up from the south, as I saw followed her tracks for the next mile. Like always, the dichotomy hit me: some emotional pain from the pristine landscape being marred with vehicular tracks, mixed with a bit of jealousy that I wasnʻt astride one of those four-wheeled beasts fighting my way through the rough path she'd traversed; that would be fun.</p>
	<p>In my opinion, the mile or two south of Kanaio Beach is more inspiring than the well travelled trail from La Perouse bay to the beach itself. There's about a mile and a half after the Kanaio where you wander along the shoreline before rejoining the KH's. There are multiple "beaches" of white coral set against the black lava which force you to stop and take notice. Like some surrealist Salvador Dalian take on a piano. Out to sea you get glimpses of Kahoʻolowe with itʻs redish brown glow. To the southeast you can see the ʻotherʻ Maui windmill farm ,the <a href="https://www.aeprenewables.com/auwahi-wind/">Auwahi Wind Turbines.</a> </p>

	<p>For those following my adventures on Maui, you already know that Iʻm a bit windmill-obsessed, and I will hike to Auwahi eventually. However, on todayʻs walk I wasnʻt expecting to get there, but I was scouting the way. And, like often happens I ran into a "No Trespassing" sign just after rejoing the KH (about 3.5 miles from La Perouse). It being in my nature, I respected the sign and turned back.</p>
	<p> The lady with the ATV was finished collecting here whatever-they-are, which were weighing down a big plastic bag. Iʻm still not sure what she was collecting, but they didnʻt look attractive.</p>
	<p> I said "hi" and she replied nicely enough. She was obviously a character. Beautiful, not at all in any traditional way, but in a life-well-lived attitude. I assume she was native to the region, and had grown up on one of the big ranches in this area. That assumption was driven by her easy manner and the fact that sheʻd driven up from the south on her ATV. The ATV looked much more like a work vehicle than either a personal toy, or way-of-life.</p>
	<p>"Beautiful morning," I said, and it certainly was.</p>
	<p>"Yes, it is," she replied, showing four of five missing teeth, but smiling widely.</p>
	<p>"Iʻm trying to get down the Kingʻs Highway all the way to the windmills," I offered. "But, I hit the no trespassing signs a ways down and decided to turn back."</p>
	<p>She laughed a bit, brightening her face even more. "Ya, you can ignore that."</p>
	<img style="width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEWQ0TgiI-YWZdzvXo0VBZMuOyM7KIwOUfjcjJkehf2YH1BrtNKh4jUyCUss9_Y14zZmorRHQF8JG535RehG6Nco4o51WD6y8cZ5OgPTmxuyAoAjb6Y5e4iXpuRjNs1ePOGkg5xgJ8dqrAlB7JD19PM4uQ=w2108-h1580-no">
	<p>"Oh?" I asked.</p>
	<p>"Yes, everyoned does."</p>
	<p>"Okay. So you can get all the way to the windmills then?"</p>
	<p>"Iʻve never done it, but my boyfriend and his buddy have. Said it was pretty straightfoward."</p>
	<p>"Excellent, Iʻll be back to do it then," I told her. "Any hunting in this area?" Between the goats and the deer here, there is a lot of culling activity to maintain some order. Many of the big ranches are aggressively going after the Axis deer, as they are ruining a lot of agricultural areas. I didnʻt want to get shot by accident.</p>
	<p>"No, no hunting in this area," she replied without hesitation, strengthening my conviction that she knew this area well. "There may be a few wild dogs further south, but weʻve never had trouble with them. Biggest thing you got to watch for is that there is nobody out there if you get into trouble. Like, nobody." Sounded even more appealing to me. </p>
	<p>"Iʻll location share with my wife," I assured her.</p>
	<p>"Good luck then," she dismissed me, and turned back to her chores.<p>
	<p> So, I have a plan. Looks like itʻs about 8.5 miles each way from La Perouse to Auwahi, so a 17 mile round trip. The KH further south looks even rougher, overgrown in places, so I figure maybe 3 mph average with some tip-toeing mixed with some jogging. Plan on 5+ hours, so Iʻll need to leave very eary. Luckily, Iʻve done the first 3.5 miles already, and itʻll be easy to do with a light, so Iʻll plan on leaving an hour before dawn.</p>
	<p>Nobody on Strava has been down this far, from what Iʻve seen. I like it that there is a highway, developed hundred of years ago, that I can walk today without following a bunch of digital trails.</p>
	<p>Iʻll update here once I make the trek. </p>
