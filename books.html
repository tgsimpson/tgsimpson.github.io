      <p>What is a true general artificial intelligence? The answer may surprise you. Ayaka and Millicent are researchers on the planet Tilt. They have developed what they believe to be the first general artificial intelligence beings. However, they’re not sure. These beings are so strange, so different, that it's difficult to understand them, let alone test them for intelligence. Certainly, the new beings don’t match the traditional definition. Everything about them is different and counter intuitive. So, when ships arrive at Tilt operated by more of these beings, the citizens of Tilt are confused and bewildered. How could intelligences that they created have ended up in outer space utilizing long distance spacecraft? Nevertheless, they seem harmless and very fragile. So it's a surprise when they attack. Thus begin the Upside-Down wars.</p>
