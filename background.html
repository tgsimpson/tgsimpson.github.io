    <h1>Background Ideas in the Upside Down Novels</h1>

    <h2> Physics </h2>
    <ul>

      <li>
        <p><em>Speed of Light</em> (often written simply as <em>c</em>, as in E=mc<sup>2</sup>): The speed of light is, according to most current physics theories, the fastest speed anything (light, information, subatomic particles) that can move through the universe. If true, it limits how fast we can move about the Universe. The closest stars to Earth are light years (how far light travels in a year) away, and to make matters worse, accelerating a spaceship to even a fraction of c requires huge amounts of energy. With today's physics and energy sources it would take centuries to travel even a few light years:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Chemical rockets (like SpaceX Falcon9) reach maximum speeds of 0.000037c </li>
          <li> Ion drives may reach 0.0003c. NASA's Dawn probe topped out at about an eighth of that. </li>
          <li> Solar sails are theorized to get to 10-20% of c, but would accelerate very slowly. </li>
          <li> Nuclear drives are theorized to max out at 0.001c </li>
          <li> Antimatter drives are highly speculative, but may take us up to 20-50%c. They are nowhere near feasible yet. </li>
        </ul>

       <p>There are many physics and science fiction ideas for overcoming this limitation. Wormholes (including black holes), quantum entanglement or tunneling, hypothetical particles like the tachyon, extra dimensions that provide shortcuts through spacetime. </p>
       <p> Since travel through space forms a large part of science fiction plots, authors often make use of these ideas. In the Upside Down novels I've attempted another idea - that c is a hard limit, but that it's possible to manipulate fields at the most fundamental quantum level to 'move' energy (and thus mass) through space without acceleration.  
       </p>
      </li>


      <li><em>Quantum Foam: A concept in quantum physics that (1) spacetime is quantized at very small levels (the Planck length), (2) at that scale fluctuations occur (due to the uncertainty principle) causing virtual particles to be created and destroyed spontaneously. The Loop Quantum Foam theory further speculates that space is made of discrete 'chunks' at Planck scales. Sting Theory, on the other hand, postulates that space is continuous and can be infinitely divided into small bits.</em> 
        <p>In the Upside Down novels I adopt the Loop Quantum Foam theory and then take it fimly into the realms of fiction. If there are 'chunks' at the Planck scale, what are they? In keeping with the quantum approach, I conceive of them as holders of probability. Quantum Foam arises because those probabilities are random; things appear and disappear without order. But, what if you could influence those probabilities, and turn foam into something less random...ultimately energy and mass? What if you could use adjacent cells to program another cell (like the Game of Life)? Then you could move information one Planck length at a time <em>without moving anything</em>. And, if you don't need to move something through space, then you don't have the limitations of general relativity with regards to mass and acceleration.</p>
        <p> I go even further into fiction, and speculate that the fastest rate by which Planck cells can transmit information is what gives rise to the speed of light, c. The speed of light is not fundamental, it comes from the clock-speed of the universe. (These are not unique ides; many writers have speculated on Planck cells and the speed of light; most serious physicists reject the idea) </p>
      </li>

      <li><em>The Casimir Effect</em> and <em>G-2</em>: There are two current indicators of quantum foam fluctuations: 
        <ul>
          <li> The Casimir Effect arises when two uncharged plates are put close together in a vacuum...and energy arises. That energy is attributed to quantum foam. </li>
          <li> G-2, or more fully, the Muon G-2 anomaly, is a discrepency between what the standard physics model predicts for a muon's spin, and what has been measured at Fermilab. One proposed reason for the discrepency is that the muon's spin is being altered by quantum foam fluctuations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In the novels, humans discover the quantum foam drive while studying the Casimir effect - that's why Titanic ships have a large plate as the drive; it's a one-sided Casimir system, where the second surface is 'programmed' by the drive. Aliens, on the other hand, develop space travel based on the G-2 anomoly. This leads them to develop tiny spaceships based on manipulating muons, a completely different technology. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Titanic Spaceships </h2>

   <p> The Titanic Spaceships are based on the idea that quantum foam is programmable...but only with a specific field. And, that field is stable only in one configuration - a 100km square surface plate. I chose a square surface (versus a round one) as a field behaves differently on each (in some ways a round surface is the obvious choice, so I avoided it). In particular, a field on a square plate has larger edge effects (allowing the Titanic drive to pull the ship behind it), and a strong net force due to the geometry. The size (100 km) is just fun... big enough to pull a huge spaceship. </p>
   <p> The living area of a Titanic spaceship is a large sphere (just a bit less than 100km diameter, so that the drive will pull it through space). The surface of the sphere is another quantum field, leading to gravity (I don't detail this much, if at all, in the novels).
