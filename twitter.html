    <p><em>Twitter Fix</em></p>
    <p>There are lots of opinions about Twitter right now (Nov 2022) as Musk's reinvention proceeds. Here is mine. </p>
    <p> Everything follows from a very simple concept, but one that is often overlooked.</p>
    <p> <em>"With freedom comes responsibility."</em></p>
    <p>The challenge is that "free speech" is very cheap, "responsibility" is expensive and dificult. In extreme cases the courts enforce responsbility, but that is a long and arduous process and not applicable for social media. </p>
    <p>This is why Identity is the wrong approach to filter on. Identity does not capture reputation. You can have people with very strong identities, but very low reputations (leaders of extremist groups, for example). You can also have people with weak identities, but very strong reputations (a village elder in a spot with almost no network access). </p>
    <p>The correct measure is reputation. Reputation is difficult to earn, and easy to lose. Reputation should drive how loud your voice is, not identity. An expert in infectious deseases, with a strong reputation, should be louder than a polititian who knows very little. </p>
    <p>Of course, some form of identity is required to uniquely identify a reputation, and some elements of identity can help to build reputation. A certified degree in a field, from a reputable institution, should build reputation. A certified degree from a dumpster (Trump University) would degrade reputation. Background checks, credit ratings, etc help to form reputation. </p>
    <p>The challenge is that the stronger the identity elements, the more they cost to establish. If every social media company did background checks on all of its users, the background check market would be in the trillions.</p>
    <p>Identity should be web-wide, and held by individuals. Reputation can be service specific. My reputation (and persona) on Twitter may be quite different than my reputation (and persona) on hackernews. There are strong emerging standards for web-wide user-controlled identity (Solid, Web5), which Twitter should embrace.</p>
    <p>Finally, the business model should encourage healthy content, and give healthy content wider distribution. That means more distribution for high reputation users and posts (many brands will meet this standard) and less distribution for low reputation users. A low reputation user may have 1M followers - that does not mean their tweets should go to all those people. Their reputation should limit their reach. A high reputation user may have few followers - that should not limit their distribution unduly.</p>
    <p>Everyone should pay for distribution, not identity. Users with high reputation should pay less. As a strawman, that will be wrong: high reputation tweets get a minimum of 10K impressions, and pay $0.001 per impression after that (billionairs with large followings can simply pay up; so can social media influencers); low reptuation tweets get 0k impressions for free, and pay $1 per impression after that :) </p>
    <p>And, of course, reputation has to evolve, and users have to know that bad behavior has a cost (there is responsibility involved).</p>
    <p>Liking, retweeting, quote tweeting...any action has a possible benefit and a possible cost. If you like something which Birdwatch or a fact checker labels as 'obviously false', then your reputation will suffer along with the original poster. if you like something supported by fact, your reputation will increase. If someone tweets "largest crowd ever", they better add an indicator that it is intended as humor, not fact.</p>
    <p>All of this is non-trivial. Building the reputation system and then managing it is much harder than charging $8/month. However, it is the right way to seperate signal from noise. Noisy people are going to pay their $8. However, they will have a hard time building and maintaining a reputation. </p>
