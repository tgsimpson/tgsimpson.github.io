    <p><em>Twitter Fix</em></p>
    <p>There are lots of opinions about Twitter right now (Nov 2022) as Musk's reinvention proceeds. Here is mine. </p>
    <p> Everything follows from a very simple concept, but one that is often overlooked.</p>
    <p> <em>"With freedom comes responsibility."</em></p>
    <p>The challenge is that "free speech" is very cheap, "responsibility" is expensive and difficult. In extreme cases the courts enforce responsbility, but that is a long and arduous process and not applicable for social media. </p>
    <p>This is why Identity is the wrong thing to build a service on. Identity does not capture quality. You can have people with very strong identities, but who post very low quality thoughts (leaders of extremist groups, for example). You can also have people with weak identities, but very content potential (a village elder). </p>
    <p>The correct measure is reputation. Reputation is difficult to earn, and easy to lose. Reputation should drive how loud your voice is; identity should not. An expert in infectious deseases, with a strong reputation but whose name few would recognize, should be louder (in relevant tweets) than a polititian who is well known but is not an expert.</p>
    <p>Of course, some form of identity is required to anchor a reputation, and some elements of identity do help to build reputation. A certified degree in a field, from a reputable institution, can build reputation. A certified degree from a degree farm would degrade reputation. Background checks, credit ratings, etc can help to form reputation. </p>
    <p>The challenge is that the stronger the identity checks, the more they cost to establish. If every social media company did background checks on all of its users, the background check market would be in the trillions. </p>
    <p>The long term solution is that Identity should be web-wide, and held by individuals, while reputation can be service specific. Users should bring their identity with them. Twitter can then put their efforts into reputation. Twitter's reputation for a user may be quite different than Hackernews....but the identity should be the same.There are strong emerging standards for web-wide user-controlled identity (Solid, Web5), which Twitter should embrace.</p>
    <p>Finally, the business model should encourage healthy content, and give meaingingful content wider distribution. That means more distribution for high reputation users and posts (many brands will meet this standard) and less distribution for low reputation users. A low reputation user may have 1M followers - that does not mean their tweets should go to all those people. Their reputation should limit their reach. A high reputation user may have few followers - that should not limit their distribution unduly.</p>
    <p>Everyone should pay for distribution, not identity. Users with high reputation should pay less. For example: high reputation tweets get a minimum of 10K free impressions, and then pay $0.001 per impression after that (billionairs with large followings can simply pay up; so can social media influencers); low reptuation tweets get 0k impressions for free, and pay $1 per impression after that :) </p>
    <p>And, of course, reputation has to evolve, and users have to know that bad behavior has a cost (there is responsibility involved).</p>
    <p>Liking, retweeting, quote tweeting...any action has a possible benefit and a possible cost. If you like something which Birdwatch or a fact checker labels as 'obviously false', then your reputation will suffer along with the original poster. If you retweet something supported by fact, your reputation will increase. If someone tweets "largest crowd ever", they better add an indicator that it is intended as humor, not fact. Humor, when obvious, should not be penalized.</p>
    <p>All of this is non-trivial. Building the reputation system and then managing it is much harder than charging $8/month for identity. However, it is the right way to seperate signal from noise. Noisy people are going to pay their $8. However, they will have a hard time building and maintaining a reputation. </p>
