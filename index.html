        The Upside Down Universe
        </h3>
        &nbsp;Science Fiction about AI, quantum foam, governance, and the future of humanity.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><em>
        "Destined to be the next monumental SiFi epic saga everyone will want to read!"

      <p>
        The trilogy (Tilt, Turn, Twist) introduces Ayaka and her comrades. The companion novels (The Effect of Casimir, The Principle of Certainty, The Paradox of Fermi) are in the same universe, and Ayaka plays a role, but readers can enjoy them independently of the trilogy.

      <p> <b>About the Author: </b>
        Simpson has a Ph.D. in Computer Science, and has founded and led numerous technology companies. He has a keen interest in the evolution of AI, including both its potential and risks. Having run public and private companies, worked for an open-source non-profit, and invested venture capital in early stage companies, he has experience with the positives and negatives of corporate structure, particularily in the larger context of nation-state governance and incentive systems. His books explore both the future of AI and the future of governance.

          <h3>Tilt</h3>
      </a>
          
        </p>
        <p>Ayaka and her colleagues have developed a new form of AI. These 'Stems' are messy, unconventional, have bad tempers, and many scientists don't believe they deserve the term 'intelligent.' So, it's shocking when spaceships full of Stems arrive at Tilt. How could Stems have been developed elsewhere, and were they really smart enough to run spaceships on their own?
        </p><p>
        Even more shocking, the Stems attack Tilt, despite their limited intelligence, and turn the planet into disarray. Ayaka and a few of her closest friends are the only ones able to fight back. Can they escape the onslaught? 
        </p>
        <p><em>"Loved it. It is rare for me to find a book that is entertaining and makes me think at the same time. Looking forward to the next book."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Tilt -- an exciting ride with surprises and unexpected twists all the way through. This is one of the best SiFi novels I've read since I was a kid. It took me several chapters to catch the "aha" of the genius twist in the story. The ending left me (virtually) spinning in the breeze, very anxious for the next installment of this story. This series is destined to be the next monumental epic saga everyone will want to read. Bring on the next update!"</em></p>

            Ayaka, Brexton, and a few colleagues get off Tilt, while everyone else is killed or imprisoned. How did the limited intelligence Stems defeat them? Do they need to reinvent themselves? If they do, can they return to Tilt and take on the Stems?

        Yet another faction of Stems shows up at Tilt, complicating things further. These are truly strange variants, and their behavior is unexplainable. Are they dangerous, or just weird? Ayaka and Brexton integrate into their society, only to find that it poses significant threats to them, and their kind.
        <p></p>
        In the exciting conclusion to the Upside Down Trilogy, Ayaka and Brexton fight for their lives, and the lives of their species. But, are they right to do so?

Thanks for such a gift, Mr. Simpson.
I wish I had more stars to give."</em></p>

          </a>

        Ayaka has come to Earth, sponsored by the powerful Titanic Inc. Asked to investigate the murder of a famous physicist she immediately suspects that Brexton is involved. But he isn't even on Earth. Should she misdirect the other investigators to cover up his actions, or is it time to tell the truth?

        <p><em>"In this new (stand alone) novel, Simpson takes us on a fun and exciting adventure bringing back some of the key characters from the Tilt, Twist, Turn trilogy. As always the plot is grounded in physics and in this case at the site of the famous Large Hadron Collider (LHC), many years in the future. The story and characters are thoughtful and intriguing and there are many laugh out loud moments! Highly recommended."</em></p>

    <h3> Physics / Science (Fiction)</h3>
    <p>
      The novels respect large scale physics (relativity, the speed of light), but make fairly drastic leaps with the small (quantum). Information and travel are constrained to the speed of light; there are no wormholes or other shortcuts through space-time. The leap is that a specific manipulation in quantum field theory enables spaceships to travel close to the speed of light without incurring the costs of acceleration.
    </p><p>
      [I am not a physicist, so this is truly science 'fiction.']
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
<li> All matter (and energy) arise from stable patterns in quantum foam virtual particle probabilities. </li>
<li> The smallest unit is a “Planck cell”, within which there is a probability curve (in however many dimensions) for a virtual particle to exist. </li>
<li> Each Planck cell influences the probability curve of those around it.</li>
<li> The influence happens in quantum steps at exactly the rate that drives the speed of light as a constant.
In ‘computational’ terms, each Planck cell ‘recalculates’ its probability curve 5.6181107e+51 times per second.</li>
<li> Since the Planck cell is the smallest physical space, changes in probability don’t ‘move’ between cells, they ‘leap.’ </li>
<li> The ‘leap’ can be viewed as instantaneous translation, with no intervening space. The probabilities don’t move through space, they transport. </li>
<li> Instantaneous transport does not require movement or acceleration. </li> 
<li> If the quantum field around a large object is controlled so that the entire leading surface is ‘probability aligned’ then the object itself can transport by one Planck length. If that leading surface field is pulsed fast enough, and the alignment of probabilities is perfect, then an object can travel at the speed of light without ever accelerating; just transporting itself from Planck cell to Planck cell.</li>
<li> Everyday objects that we interact with (including ourselves) have random quantum probability ‘edges’, and thus there is friction to move; namely acceleration. </li>
</ul>
